##### retropie

##### tenderloin
- I have no idea why this device is codenamed tenderloin in pretty much every Open Source OS. I think [its official codename is Topaz](https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/2/5264580/the-lost-secrets-of-webos).

##### steamlink
- The steamlink has the innarts of a Chromecast gen 1
- The steamlink has KODI and retroarch working, but no custom kernel due to locked bootloader
- As of 2018, there are some kexec workaround to load an entirely new kernel but that's very hacky

##### hackmii_unbrick
- The wii has a nand with no write protection that makes it possible to completely mess it up

##### hc0xbt
- You need a parallel port on your computer to flash the firmware to the HC-0x
